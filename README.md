A machine learning project that trains a large language model to generate original text in the style of William Shakespeare. This repository is based on a tutorial project I followed from YouTube, where I learned the fundamentals of training an LLM for creative text generation. I’ve cloned and adapted the project for learning and experimentation purposes.

The result is a model capable of producing Shakespeare-like dialogue, prose, and poetry using modern deep learning techniques.

🚀 Features

Trains a language model on Shakespeare’s works

Generates original text in a Shakespearean style

Fully reproducible training pipeline

Great hands-on introduction to:

Tokenization

Language modeling

Text generation with neural networks

🧠 How It Works

This project follows a standard LLM training pipeline:

Dataset Preparation – Shakespeare’s text is cleaned and tokenized.

Model Architecture – A neural network is trained for next-token prediction.

Training Loop – The model learns linguistic patterns over many iterations.

Text Generation – Given a starting prompt, the model generates Shakespeare-style text.
